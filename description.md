# Cancer Research Uk Bioinformatics Winter School 2016: Essential Data Analysis Skills for Biologists
## December 7th - 9th, Cambridge

# Outline

This three day course is intended to open doors to applying statistics - whether directly increasing skills and personally undertaking analyses, or by expanding knowledge towards identifying collaborators. The end goal is to drive confident engagement with data analysis and further training - increasing the quality and reliability of interpretation, and putting that interpretation and subsequent presentation into the hands of the researcher. Each day of the course will deliver a mixture of lecture, workshop and hands-on practice – and will focus on the following specific elements.

# Venue

# Prerequisites

This course is aimed at beginners, no prior knowledge is required

# Programme

## Day 1
Day 1 focuses on basic approaches and the computer skills required to do downstream analysis. Covering: Basic skills for data manipulation in R. How to prepare your data effectively. Principles of experimental design and how this influences analysis.

## Day 2
On day 2, participants will explore the core concepts of statistics – so that they can begin to see how they can be applied to their own work, and to also help with better critical evaluation of the work of others. Covering: Basic statistics concepts and practice: power, variability, false discovery, t-test, effect size, simulations to understand what a p-value means.

## Day 3
On day 3 will use some practical statistics examples in R to introduce concepts in data presentation for publication. Covering: Some practical examples of statistics in R. Visualising and publishing your data.
