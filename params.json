  "body": "### Outline\r\nThis three day course is intended to open doors to applying statistics - whether directly increasing skills and personally undertaking analyses, or by expanding knowledge towards identifying collaborators. The end goal is to drive confident engagement with data analysis and further training - increasing the quality and reliability of interpretation, and putting that interpretation and subsequent presentation into the hands of the researcher. Each day of the course will deliver a mixture of lecture, workshop and hands-on practice.\r\n\r\n### Instructors\r\n\r\n- Aaron Lun\r\n- [Catalina Vallejos](https://sites.google.com/site/catalinavallejosmeneses/)\r\n- [Hugo Tavares](http://www.slcu.cam.ac.uk/directory/tavares-hugo)\r\n- [Aiora Zabala](http://aiorazabala.net/)\r\n\r\n## Keynote lectures\r\n\r\n- [John Marioni](http://www.cruk.cam.ac.uk/research-groups/marioni-group)\r\n- [Florian Markowetz](http://www.markowetzlab.org/)\r\n\r\n### Aims\r\nDuring this course you will learn about:\r\n- The importance of Reproducible Research and how tools such as R can help\r\n- Planning your experiment and why good experimental design is critical\r\n- How to use spreadsheet programs (such as Excel) more effectively, and the limitations of such programs\r\n- Writing and executing basic data analysis workflows in R\r\n- Formulating and interpreting the result of a statistical test\r\n- Choosing the appropriate graphics to understand and present your data\r\n\r\n### Objectives\r\n\r\nAfter this course you should be able to:\r\n- Identify sources of variation and confounding in your experimental design and prepare for a consultation with a statistician\r\n- Assess the distribution of your data and choose the appropriate statistical test; recognising any limitations that may exist\r\n- Create a reproducible piece of R code to import, visualise and perform a statistical test on biological data\r\n- Know how to develop your data analysis skills after the course\r\n",
